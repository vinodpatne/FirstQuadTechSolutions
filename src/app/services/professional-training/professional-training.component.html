                <h3>It’s a classic dilemma: To get a job, you need experience. But to gain experience, you need a job.
                    <span class="text-primary">So, what’s the solution?</span>
                </h3>
                <p>Internships are one of the main routes to work experience. However, they are notoriously difficult to secure without prior work experience, relocation or the right contacts.</p>
                <p>Finding the right internship as a student has become one of the most difficult tasks today. With most employers looking for candidates with some work experience, students can't ignore the benefits and experience of internships. This is even more important for students of Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT) and related subjects. </p>
                <p>Our unique platform ensures intelligent and rapid matching between students and companies, training students during their internship and opening up a global network of relationships.</p>
